# Statistic

## Big Data Analytics with R and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning

Statistics is the science, part of Applied Mathematics, which provides methods for collecting, describing, analyzing, present and interpret data, for use by themselves in decision making.

Statistics has several applications and fulfills the most different purposes, being especially useful and sometimes indispensable when it comes to Data Science. We use Statistics to describe, summarize and explore the Data. When working with Machine Learning, we use Statistics to interpret and evaluate model results.

## 1. Challenge

This entire section will be dedicated to laboratory studies of Data Analysis, with real and public data, using the R language. In this context I intend to address several business problems in order to solve them improving my technical skills.

It is a practical laboratory with the objective of demonstrating, in a clear and objective way, the application of some of the main statistical techniques used.
in Data Science

## 2. Laboratories

|               | **Project**        | **Scopo**                                | **Business Question**           |                      |
|:-------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------------------------------|:--------------------------------|:---------------------|
| **Lab_01**    | **ANOVA** | ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical test used to verify if the "AVERAGES" of two or more groups are significantly different from each other. Usually the ANOVA will be applied to compare more than 2 groups. ANOVA is similar to the t test (which we will see in another Statistics in Practice), the difference is that if you want to compare more than two groups will use ANOVA.  | A pharmaceutical company tested three formulations of a drug for pain relief for headache sufferers (specifically migraine). For the experiment, 27 volunteers were selected and 9 were randomly assigned to a of the three drug formulations. Subjects were instructed to take the drug during the next episode of migraine and report your pain on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the strongest pain) |
| **Lab_02**    | **Shapiro-Wilk Test, F Test and t Test** | In this project we will use the ‚Äúsleep‚Äù dataset available in the package as a data source datasets in R. This dataset is the result of a research work with patients who have difficulties sleeping. Patients were separated into 2 groups and each group received a different medication to treat sleep disorders and help increase sleep time |Our aim in this study is to answer the following question: ‚ÄúThere is a significant difference in the average sleep of the 2 groups of patients, that is, there is significant difference between the two drugs that help with the sleep disorder?‚Äù |
| **Lab_03**    | **Dashboard with Shiny for Automation Statistical Tests** | In this project the objective of this work is to demonstrate the use and interpretation of some important statistical tests (parametric and non-parametric). 5 tests will be addressed in this work: 1. One-Sample t-Test (parametric) \| 2. Two-Sample t-Test (parametric) \| 3.  Wilcoxon test (non-parametric) \| 4. Shapiro-Wilk test (non-parametric) \| 5. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (non-parametric) | 1. Use and interpretation of parametric and non-parametric statistical tests \| 2. Understanding which statistical test to choose for analysis according to the objective \| 3. Automation of statistical tests through interactive Dashboard |
